    "## Team Members: Alex Kagan, Daniele Bracale, Josh Wasserman, Xinhe Wang, and Yash Patel\n",
    "We present herein the findings from our explorations on the ripening of bananas. The specific experiment of interest was to see if bananas' ripening is affected by exposure to different \"accompanying\" fruits, specifically apples and tomotoes. In this report, we present some our experimental design along with the raw data processing pipeline, statistical analyses, and conclusions. The report is, therefore, broken into the following sections:\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Fruits in general ripen through the conversion of starch to sugars. Ideally, we’d be able to measure this conversion process chemically, but we don’t have access to refractometers. We can define the \"true\" ripeness as being this ratio of sugars to starches. So, we use a number of proxies that correlate strongly with this ripeness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Starch, a complex carbohydrate, is broken into simple sugars through a reaction with ethylene. However, this release of ethylene also results in a number of other reactions that are clearly visible. Specifically, ethylene additionally breaks down pectin, which is responsible for the structural integrity of the banana. This is why bananas also grow softer as they ripen. Similarly, the release of ethylene results in the breakdown of chlorophyll, which then gives rise to the characteristic yellow and eventual browning color of bananas. This is surprisingly the same process that happens with leaves, although not all the same pigments are present in banana skins, which is why there is only really a progression from yellow to brown.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we want to conceptually measure:\n",

    "## Experimental measures\n",
    "**Color**: The color of bananas characteristically changes in two ways in ripening: becoming more yellow and subsequently developing brown spots. We, therefore, have two measures towards this end. For both, we took a picture of the banana on a white piece of paper, placing a \"registration\" grey card (printed) to serve as a fixed normalization point for white balance in post-processing. In post-processing, after normalizing colors, we segmented the banana in the image and ran a connected components segmentation analysis to find the \"brown spots,\" computing the area as the number of pixels (as a proportion to the total area). For the remainder of the banana, note that (idealized) green in RGB is (0, 255, 0), whereas (idealized) yellow is (255, 255, 0), so the average red channel should serve as a rough proxy for the ripeness (w.r.t. color). Part of the reason for this bifurcated analysis is to account for the fact brown does not have a greater red value than yellow, meaning there is an inflection in the red channel with respect to ripeness which would skew results were the average run pre-segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Firmness**: For this, on the final day of the experiment, we unpeeled the banana and cut off a 2\" segment from the middle. This segment was then glued on a white piece of paper. We then placed a fixed weight (a cast iron pan) atop it for a fixed period of time (5 seconds). We took a picture before and after exposure to the weight and measured the percentage change in the resulting number of pixels as a measure of how much the banana got \"squished.\""

    "## RGB Analysis\n",
    "In this section we process the data in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Collect all the bananas' pictures for each day.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each picure, make a selection, i.e. select the banana only and put it in a completely white background. This helps in having pixels not corresponding to a banana location be equal to $(255,255,255)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Read each picture from previous step in R and count the number of non-white pixels, i.e. the pixels corresponding to the banana.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Transform the picture into \"greyscale\" in order to have a unique channel and being able to select the brown spots with a uniform measure. Count the number of pixels with values less than $0.5$ (recall that in R the maximum RGB value is $1$ instead of $255$) and divide this number by the number of non-white pixels in step 2. The result is the proportion of black spots in the banana. Then $1$ minus this proportion is the proportion of yellow (non-brown) spots. Take also the average of the red channel values corresponding to the non-brown spots.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Collect the data for the proportion of brown spots, yellow spots and the average of red spots for each banana and output a csv file. For each banana we also add a variable that specify the treatment: $C$ for control, $A$ for apple and $T$ for tomato."
